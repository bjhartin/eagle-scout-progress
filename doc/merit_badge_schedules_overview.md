# Merit Badge Work Schedules Overview

This document provides an overview of the two merit badge completion schedules created to help organize Eagle Scout badge requirements.

## Schedule Files

- **`merit_badge_schedule_september.md`** - Aggressive schedule targeting completion by September 30th
- **`merit_badge_schedule_october.md`** - Balanced schedule targeting completion by October 31st

## Schedule Features

### Format
- **Calendar Layout**: Each schedule uses monthly calendar tables showing daily assignments
- **Abbreviated Names**: Tasks shown as "Fam. Life - 4a" or "Cit. in Nation: 1b" format as requested
- **Time Allocation**: Monday-Friday (2 hrs/day), Saturday-Sunday (4 hrs/day)

### Priority System
Both schedules prioritize work based on:
1. **Time-sensitive requirements first**: Family Life 90-day tracking must start August 4th
2. **Longest badges first**: Citizenship in Community (21.5 hrs) → Emergency Preparedness (14 hrs) → etc.
3. **Special requirements noted**: 5-day waiting periods and tracking requirements

## Schedule Differences

- **Pace**: Intensive, uses ~85% of available time
- **Completion**: All merit badge work done by September 30th (except Family Life tracking continues to Nov 2)
- **Best for**: Scouts who want to finish early and have extra time for Eagle Project

### October Schedule (Balanced)
